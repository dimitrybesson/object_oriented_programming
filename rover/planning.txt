######MISSION CONTROL
will create Plateau.new
def create_plateau(plateau_x, plateau_y)
  new_plateau = Plateau.new(x, y)
  plateau_list << new_plateau
end

will create Rover.new
def create_rover(name, x, y, direction)
  new_rover = Rover.new(name, x, y, direction)
  rover_list << new_rover
end


######PLATEAU
Plateau knows the location of all of its rovers
(perhaps have a method that does a visual representation of the plateau)


######ROVER
 Ideally, rover knows the plateau it is on

 Perhaps the rover can have a navigation function within itself, as in it understands whether or not it is at the edge of the plateau and whether or not it can move forward
 Maybe this method can switch on if there is ever a problem with mission control
 As in if a communication method ever encounters an error, we rescue with this new method
 (Perhaps create a method that does a visual display of the plateau?)


######EXCEPTION
It would be cool if I could have the exception show where you were in the instructions and maybe ask you if you woul like to augment them. Also maybe a visual representation of the location
